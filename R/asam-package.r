#' Anti-shipping Activity Messages ('ASAM') include the locations and
#' descriptive accounts of specific hostile acts against ships and mariners.
#' The reports may be useful for recognition, prevention and avoidance of
#' potential hostile activity. A snapshot of the official 'ASAM' database is
#' included along with utilities to update the local database and the
#' official polygons defining the 'ASAM' global regions and subregions.
