Description: Anti-shipping Activity Messages ('ASAM') include the locations and
    descriptive accounts of specific hostile acts against ships and mariners.
    The reports may be useful for recognition, prevention and avoidance of
    potential hostile activity. A snapshot of the official 'ASAM' database is
    included along with utilities to update the local database and the
    official polygons defining the 'ASAM' global regions and subregions.
