Description: Anti-shipping Activity Messages (ASAM) include the locations and
    descriptive accounts of specific hostile acts against ships and mariners.
    The reports may be useful for recognition, prevention and avoidance of
    potential hostile activity. The 'asam' package provides a snapshot of the
    official ASAM database, utilities to update the local database and the
    official polygons defining the ASAM global regions and subregions.
