Description: Anti-shipping Activity Messages ('ASAM') include the locations and
    descriptive accounts of specific hostile acts against ships and mariners.
    The reports may be useful for recognition, prevention and avoidance of
    potential hostile activity. Tools are provided to download the official 'ASAM' 
    database along with a geojson version of the official polygons defining the 
    'ASAM' global regions and subregions. Data is from <https://msi.nga.mil/Piracy>
