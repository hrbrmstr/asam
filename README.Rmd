`asam` is an R package providing tools to access, download, update, process and visualize [Anti-shipping Activity Messages](http://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=msi_portal_page_65) (ASAM) Database Files

Anti-shipping Activity Messages (ASAM) include the locations and
descriptive accounts of specific hostile acts against ships and mariners.
The reports may be useful for recognition, prevention and avoidance of
potential hostile activity. The 'asam' package provides a snapshot of the
official ASAM database, utilities to update the local database and the
official polygons defining the ASAM global regions and subregions.

The following functions are implemented:

- `asam_refresh`:	Refresh ASAM database
- `asam_shp`:	ASAM (Anti-shipping Activity Messages) Data (shapefile)
- `asam_subregions`:  Retrieve ASAM subregions polygons

The following data sets are included:

- `data(asam_shp)` : Snapshot of the ASAM dataset
- `system.file("geojson/asam.geojson", package="asam")` : Official ASAM regions & subregions shapefile
